Patches
================


Storage for various patches needed for some tests and benchmarks.
These patches are actually git diffs compared to master. The exact
branch and version of the master are stored for each file individually.

If everything goes right, you should be able to apply these patches
simply by using 

```
$ git apply <patch_file_name>
```


- `patch_fixed_nr_subcycles`
    Fix the number of sub-cycles. I.e. the `TimeIntegration:max_nr_sub_cycles`
    parameter is not used as an upper limit, but as the exact ratio of sub-cyle
    to hydro-step. Used for benchmarks.

    Patch was originally stored on `origin/GEARRT_fixed_nr_subcycles` branch, commit 9d660cec5d660fdec7968db4fbbad66957296083.
    Patch was diffed from master branch with commit b168f7a15e781ec48631300e7449092a49c114b6.


- `patch_extra_task_timing_data`
    Collect and write out a lot of additional timing data. Used for the weak
    scaling benchmark.

    Patch was originally stored on `origin/rt_scaling_setup` branch, commit fdde94eba27bb688152dc8641de43f11119a5937.
    Patch was diffed from master branch with commit b168f7a15e781ec48631300e7449092a49c114b6.
