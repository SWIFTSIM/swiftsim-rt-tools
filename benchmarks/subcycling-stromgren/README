Run sub-cycling speedup tests.

Solve the same problem, a simple stromgren sphere in 3D, using
varying numbers of sub-cycles.

These tests were run using a modification - we always force a fixed number
of sub-cycles, instead of using a dynamically determined ratio of RT updates per
hydro step. See `swiftsim-rt-toos/patches/patch_fixed_nr_subcycles`.


Instructions:
Select resolution (64, 128) and write it into file named `resolution`

Check other files in this directory:
-  job-stromgren-subcycling.slm will be used as job template which will be launched later in ./run_sims.sh
-  the .yml files in this directory are also templates which will be used to run the sims.


Then run:

./setup.sh              # sets up subdirs, makes batch job files and yml paramfiles
./run_sims.sh           # submits jobs to slurm queues
./gather_results.sh     # get relevant data into a single directory (once runs are finished)
./plotSpeedup.py        # make plots


Other scripts:

- compareSpeedup.py
    If you're running two different runs which you want to compare, e.g.
    a run with hydro+RT and a run with hydro+RT+gravity, you can use
    the ./compareSpeedup.py script.
    It needs you to put the result files (timing, and timesteps.txt) into
    two different subdirectories, one for each run. E.g.
    "subcycling-stromgren" and "subcycling-stromgren-grav"

- deprecated/plotSpeedupFromSubdirs.py
    when running `./setup.sh`, the script will create directories for
    each simulation individually, e.g. `stromgren_test_1`, 
    `stromgren_test_2`, etc.
    This script takes the result files directly from these directories,
    and allows you to skip the `gather_results.sh` stage of the intended workflow.


Additionally, other versions of the stromgren sphere setups are available.
The default includes hydrogen and helium. You can also run the same for a single
photon group (yml files with `singlebin` in filename) and for just hydrogen
(yml files with `MF` instead of `MFHHe` in filename).
They are stored in the `additional_ymlfiles` directory.
