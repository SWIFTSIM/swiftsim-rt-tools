Run sub-cycling speedup tests.

Solve the same problem, a simple stromgren sphere in 3D, using
varying numbers of sub-cycles.


Instructions:
Select resolution (64, 128) and write it into file named `resolution`

Check other files in this directory:
-  job-stromgren-subcycling.slm will be used as job template which will be launched later in ./run_sims.sh
-  the .yml files in this directory are also templates which will be used to run the sims.


Then run:

./setup.sh              # sets up subdirs, makes batch job files and yml paramfiles
./run_sims.sh           # submits jobs to slurm queues
./gather_results.sh     # get relevant data into a single directory (once runs are finished)
./plotSpeedup.py        # make plots
