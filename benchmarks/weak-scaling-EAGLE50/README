Weak Scaling Benchmark
----------------------

Using the EAGLE_50 low_z box.
Make sure you get the ICs and put them in this dir.


Instructions:

Check other files in this directory:
-  job-EAGLE-weak-scaling.slm will be used as job template which will be launched later in ./run_sims.sh
-  the .yml file in this directory is also a template which will be used to run the sims.


Then run:

./setup.sh              # sets up subdirs, makes batch job files and yml paramfiles
./run_sims.sh           # submits jobs to slurm queues
./gather_results.sh     # get relevant data into a single directory (once runs are finished)
./plotScaling.py        # make plots

If you have written out extra timing data, you may want to use `plotScalingWithExtraData.py`.
Note that this script requires a modified version of SWIFT. See  swiftsim-rt-tools/patches/README and
