GEAR-RT Units Check
=====================


Run a couple of tests to verify whether your choice of units for a simulation 
might be incompatible with the precision limits for the internal thermochemistry 
computations.


Instructions
-------------

1)  Generate simulation data parameters
    You need to generate a .yml file that contains a bunch of simulation 
    parameters that are necessary for this test to be run. See 
    `simulation_parameter_example.yml` for a list of all required parameters.
    Alternatively, you could run `generate_simulation_parameter_file.py` on
    a SWIFT snapshot or IC hdf5 file, which will generate the output for you,
    provided the IC file contains all the required units.
    Note that you can freely edit the resulting simulation parameter file
    afterwards, e.g. if you want to test out different min/max particle 
    densities you might reach when the simulation evolves.

2)  Provide `main.c` with the correct SWIFT runtime parameter file
    Locate the definition of 
        `char *swift_param_filename = "swift_parameters.yml";`
    in `main()` in `main.c`, and change the file name to the SWIFT parameter
    file that you intend to use for your simulation.

3)  define how many photon groups you are planning to run the simulation 
    with at the top of the file `main.c`, e.g. `#define RT_NGROUPS 4`

4)  Compile and run the test suite using `run.sh`

5)  If at any point the code throws an error, it means that most likely your 
    choice of units is not suitable for a run.
