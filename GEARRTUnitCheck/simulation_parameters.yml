ParticleData:
  ParticleMass: 1.      # particle mass (in internal units)
  minDensity: 0.        # (estimate of) minimal density in simulation (in internal units)
  maxDensity: 0.        # (estimate of) maximal density in simulation (in internal units)
  averageDensity: 0.    # average density in simulation (in internal units). NOTE: if = 0., the code will try to compute its own average density based on boxsize, particle mass, and particle number, and try min/max densities with a factor of 10^{+-3}
  smoothingLength: 1.   # (estimate of) typical smoothing length (in internal units). If = 0., the code will try to compute its own estimate.
