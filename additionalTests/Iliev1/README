Iliev Test 1
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2006 (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1625I/) Test 1
Details:

- hydrogen gas only.
- the gas density distribution is fixed.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.
- source of ionizing radiation should be monochromatic at 13.6eV and emits at a 
  rate of 5e48 photons / s.
- temperature is fixed at 10^4 K throughout the run.
- Box dimension of original test is L = 6.6kpc, but their source is in the 
  corner of the box. So we take twice that. (plus a bit extra for boundary particles)
- Gas number density nH = 10^-3 cm^-3
- Ionization photon number rate is Ndot = 5 * 10^48 photons/s. This translates
  to the luminosity L = 6.198024e+04 L_Sun.
- Initial ionization fraction: x = 1.2 * 10^-3
- run up to 500 Myr


To mimic the monochromatic radiation source, we need to use 1 frequency bin, starting
at the hydrogen ionizing frquency, and we then cut off the constant spectrum at a frequency
which is very close to it. So compile with --with-rt=GEAR_1


Notes
-------

This test requires a fixed density for particles throughout the simulation.
You can find instructions on how to fix the density field for GEAR-RT in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_turn_off_hydrodynamics_evolution.md

This test also requires a treatment for boundary particles. The initial 
conditions are set up to use a glass file for an inner region of the example,
and an additional outer uniform particle distribution which constitutes an extra
boundary particle layer. To accomodate the extra boundary particles, the box
size is increased compared to the one prescribed in the Iliev+2006 paper.
You can find instructions on how to deal with boundary particles for GEAR-RT in 
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_boundary_particles.md

If you additionally want to extract the positions of the ionization front 
at each time step, instructions to do so are provided in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_get_ionization_front_each_step.md

Finally, the instructions on how to turn off the temperature evolution is given in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_fix_temperature.md
