Reference solutions for Iliev+06 Test 1.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603199 and 
https://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~iti20/RT_comparison_project/tests1-4.html

Files:
    *_xHI.dat : contain neutral hydrogen mass fraction
    *_Ifront.dat: contains simulation time in Myr, I-front radius in kpc, and I-front velocity in km/s

File Contents for *_xHI.dat:
    first column: mean value
    second column: standard deviation

    all files have 128 lines, corresponding to the 128 cells in each
    dimension that the reference tests have. The cell size is not
    provided in these files, look it up yourself in the paper.


Concerning the ionization front of Ritzerveld/SimpleX: Technically that data
is available, but it's formatted weirdly. In the source repository of the data,
there is one file for the radius, and another one for the velocities. The files
do not have the same number of rows. For simplicity and in order to be able to
use a single format to read the data in, I've omitted that data as a reference
in this test.

Rijkhorst/Flash, like Zeus, only had positions and time provided. I zero-padded 
the velocities.
