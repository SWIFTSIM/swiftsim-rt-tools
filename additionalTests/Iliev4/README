Iliev Test 4
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2006 (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1625I/) Test 4
Details:

- hydrogen gas only.
- the gas density distribution is fixed.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.

CHECK THE REST HERE
- source of ionizing radiation has black-body spectrum with T_bb = 10^5K
- initially the gas is fully neutral and at 100K.
- Box dimension of original test is L = 6.6kpc, but their source is in the 
  corner of the box. So we take twice that. (plus a bit extra for boundary particles)
- Gas number density nH = 10^-3 cm^-3
- Ionization photon number rate is Ndot = 5 * 10^48 photons/s. This translates
  to the luminosity L = 6.198024e+04 L_Sun.
- run up to 100 Myr


Notes
-------

The 'IlievTest4ICData.hdf5' file contains extracted data that are required to set 
up the initial conditions propertly. While it resembles a SWIFT IC file a little,
it is not a proper IC file itself, and SWIFT won't be able to run with it.
Furthermore, it abuses star masses to store the halo masses for the sources of
radiation, which then determine their luminosity.

This test requires a fixed density for particles throughout the simulation.
You can find instructions on how to fix the density field for GEAR-RT in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_turn_off_hydrodynamics_evolution.md

This test also requires a treatment for boundary particles. The initial 
conditions are set up to use a glass file for an inner region of the example,
and an additional outer uniform particle distribution which constitutes an extra
boundary particle layer. To accomodate the extra boundary particles, the box
size is increased compared to the one prescribed in the Iliev+2006 paper.
