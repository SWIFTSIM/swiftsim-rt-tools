Iliev Test 4
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2006 (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1625I/) Test 4
Details:

- hydrogen gas only.
- the gas density distribution is fixed.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.
- source of ionizing radiation has black-body spectrum with T_bb = 10^5K
- for the 'soft' spectrum, source of ionizing radiation has black-body 
  spectrum with T_bb = 3 x 10^4K
- initially the gas is fully neutral and at 100K.
- boxsize is 0.5 COMOVING Mpc / h
- run up to 0.4 Myr. Reference solutions are available for 0.05 Myr, 0.1 Myr,
  0.2 Myr, and 0.4 Myr.




Notes
-------

The '100c' setup is a setup to increase the speed of light by a factor of 100 in
an attempt to mimic reference code's behaviour of having instant speed of light.

The 'IlievTest4ICData.hdf5' file contains extracted data that are required to set 
up the initial conditions propertly. While it resembles a SWIFT IC file a little,
it is not a proper IC file itself, and SWIFT won't be able to run with it.
Furthermore, it abuses star masses to store the halo masses for the sources of
radiation, which then determine their luminosity. Note also that all the data in
the 'IlievTest4ICData.hdf5' file contains *physical* values, not comoving ones.

This test requires a fixed density for particles throughout the simulation.
You can find instructions on how to fix the density field for GEAR-RT in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_turn_off_hydrodynamics_evolution.md

This test also requires a treatment for boundary particles. The initial 
conditions are set up to use uniformly distributed particles for an inner region of the example,
and an additional outer uniform particle distribution which constitutes an extra
boundary particle layer. To accomodate the extra boundary particles, the box
size is increased compared to the one prescribed in the Iliev+2006 paper.
