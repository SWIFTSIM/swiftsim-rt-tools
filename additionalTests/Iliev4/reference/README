Reference solutions for Iliev+06 Test 4.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603199 and 
https://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~iti20/RT_comparison_project/tests1-4.html

Files:
All files contain a slice along the midplane of size 128 x 128 cells.
    *_T_z=64.dat : contain temperature in K
    *_xHI_z=64.dat : contain neutral hydrogen mass fraction

Codes used to create the output and output times are given in the file name.

<CODE>_soft_<XMyr>_[T,xHI]_z=64.dat files contain the solutions for the 'soft' 
blackbody spectrum with T = 3 * 10^4 K used instead of 10^5.

Note that the published SimpleX temperature data is just zeros, and thus 
skipped here.
