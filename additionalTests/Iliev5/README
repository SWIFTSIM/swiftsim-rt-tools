Iliev Test 5
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2009 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.400.1283I) Test 5

Details:

- hydrogen gas only.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.
- source of ionizing radiation has black-body spectrum with T_bb = 10^5K
- initially the gas is fully neutral and at 100K.
- Box dimension of original test is L = 15kpc, but their source is in the 
  corner of the box. So we take twice that. (plus a bit extra for boundary particles)
- Gas number density nH = 10^-3 cm^-3
- Ionization photon number rate is Ndot = 5 * 10^48 photons/s. This translates
  to the luminosity L = 6.198024e+04 L_Sun. (for one photon group)
- run up to 500 Myr. Reference solutions are available for 10 Myr, 30 Myr, 100 Myr,
  200 Myr, and 500 Myr.


Notes
-------

This test also requires a treatment for boundary particles. The initial 
conditions are set up to use a glass file for an inner region of the example,
and an additional outer uniform particle distribution which constitutes an extra
boundary particle layer. To accomodate the extra boundary particles, the box
size is increased compared to the one prescribed in the Iliev+2009 paper.
You can find instructions on how to deal with boundary particles for GEAR-RT in 
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_boundary_particles.md

If you additionally want to extract the positions of the ionization front 
at each time step, instructions to do so are provided in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_get_ionization_front_each_step.md

Note that in this test (as opposed to previous Iliev tests in this repository) marks
boundary particles as particles with IDs *below* 1000000000.

So for GEARRT, configure swift with

--with-rt=GEAR_3 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-stars=basic --with-feedback=none --enable-fixed-boundary-particles=99999999
