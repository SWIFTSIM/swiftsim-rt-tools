Iliev0part2
    Pure hydrogen isothermal HII region expansion for fixed density field

Iliev0part3
    Single-zone ionizing up and cooling and recombining

Iliev1
    Pure hydrogen isothermal HII region expansion for fixed density field
    at fixed temperature and monochromatic source

Iliev2
    Pure hydrogen isothermal HII region expansion for fixed density field

Iliev3
    I-front trapping in a dense clump and formation of a shadow

Iliev4
    16 sources in a static cosmological density field

InjectionConvergenceTest
    Run Iliev2 test on varying underlying resolutions and compare convergence.

instructions
    contains instructions on how to modify the code to be able to achieve
    certain behaviours. E.g. disable particle heating, hydrodynamics interactions,
    set a fixed radiation field that switches off, etc.

MiniStromgren_3D
    A small 3D Stromgren sphere test. Useful for quick tests during development.

rainbow4_colormap.py
    A colormap that is hurtful to the eyes, but very similar to what was used
    in the Iliev et al. papers, intended to facilitate easy comparisons with
    the original plots.

stromgren_plotting_tools.py
    A collection of commonly used functions for plotting
