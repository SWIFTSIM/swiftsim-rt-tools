Iliev2
    Pure hydrogen isothermal HII region expansion for fixed density field

InjectionConvergenceTest
    Run Iliev2 test on varying underlying resolutions and compare convergence.

instructions
    contains instructions on how to modify the code to be able to achieve
    certain behaviours. E.g. disable particle heating, hydrodynamics interactions,
    set a fixed radiation field that switches off, etc.

MiniStromgren_3D
    A small 3D Stromgren sphere test. Useful for quick tests during development.
