Injection Convergence Test
--------------------------------

Runs the same test on varying resolutions, ranging from 16^3 to 128^3.

The test is a copy of the Iliev2 test. PLEASE refer to the details described
there on what modifications SWIFT requires to be able to correctly run the 
test.

Note that the resolution refers to the inner region of the problem. There are
a handful of rows of extra boundary particles added in the ICs.
