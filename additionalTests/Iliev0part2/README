Iliev 0 Test Part 2
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2006 (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1625I/) Test 0, part 2.

NOTE: This test is pretty much exactly the same as the Test 2, but with modified
interaction rates. Better run the Test 2, as we have reference solutions for it.
Furthermore, in the provided Test 2 in this repository, a treatment of boundary
particles is used and described, such that the results in the outer regions of
the box are better resolved.


Details:
- hydrogen gas only.
- the gas density distribution is fixed.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.
- source of ionizing radiation has black-body spectrum with T_bb = 10^5K
- initially the gas is fully neutral and at 100K.
- Box dimension of original test is L = 6.6kpc, but their source is in the 
  corner of the box. So we take twice that.
- Gas number density nH = 10^-3 cm^-3
- Ionization photon number rate is Ndot = 5 * 10^48 photons/s. This translates
  to the luminosity L = 6.198024e+04 L_Sun. 
- Initial ionization fraction: x = 1.2 * 10^-3
- run up to 100 Myr


Notes
-------

This test requires a fixed density for particles throughout the simulation.
You can find instructions on how to fix the density field for GEAR-RT in
swiftsim-rt-tools/additionalTests/instructions/GEARRT_turn_off_hydrodynamics_evolution.md


TODO:
- Increase box size to avoid noise arising from periodicity issues.
--->  this ToDo is solved in the Test 2 example (swiftsim-rt-toolss/additionalTests/Iliev2)
