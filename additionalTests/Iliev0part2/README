Iliev 0 Test
-----------------------

Reproducing Iliev+2006 (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1625I/) Test 0.
Details:

- hydrogen gas only.
- the gas density distribution is fixed.
- original test in paper was in 128^3 cells.
- source of ionizing radiation has black-body spectrum with T_bb = 10^5K
- initially the gas is fully neutral and at 100K.
- Box dimension of original test is L = 6.6kpc, but their source is in the 
  corner of the box. So we take twice that.
- Gas number density nH = 10^-3 cm^-3
- Ionization photon number rate is Ndot = 5 * 10^48 photons/s. This translates
  to the luminosity L = 6.198024e+04 L_Sun. 

  TODO: is this relevant?
  I set an upper frequency limit to 10 times
  the frequency at which the blackbody spectrum peaks.

TODO: this is for Test 2
- Initial ionization fraction: x = 1.2 * 10^-3

Notes
-------

-   To achieve constant density for GEAR-RT with Gizmo, you need to modify the
    code internally as follows:

    1)  Keep particles static. You can either declare all particles in the
        simulation boundary particles at compile time, or you can activate the
        `#GIZMO_FIXED_PARTICLES` macro in `src/const.h`

    2)  Disable all particle interactions. E.g. add 

        ```
          dt_therm = 0.f;
          dt_grav = 0.f;
          dt_kick_corr = 0.f;
        ```

        at the top of `src/hydro/Gizmo/hydro.h:hydro_kick_extra()` function.
