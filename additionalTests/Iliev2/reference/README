Reference solutions for Iliev+06 Test 2.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603199 and 
https://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~iti20/RT_comparison_project/tests1-4.html

Files:
    *_T.dat : contain temperature in K
    *_xHI.dat : contain neutral hydrogen mass fraction
    *_Ifront.dat: contains simulation time in Myr, I-front radius in kpc, and I-front velocity in km/s

File Contents for *_T.dat, *_xHI.dat:
    first column: mean value
    second column: standard deviation

    all files have 128 lines, corresponding to the 128 cells in each
    dimension that the reference tests have. The cell size is not
    provided in these files, look it up yourself in the paper.
