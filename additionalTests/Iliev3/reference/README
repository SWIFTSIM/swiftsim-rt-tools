Files:
Codes used to create the output and output times are given in the file name.

All files that contain 'slice' in the filename contain a slice along the midplane 
of size 128 x 128 cells.
    *_T_z=64.dat : contain temperature in K
    *_xHI_z=64.dat : contain neutral hydrogen mass fraction

All files that contain 'profile' in the filename contain the profile along the
axis of symmetry of 128 cells.
    *profile_Tdat : contain temperature in K
    *profile_xHI.dat : contain neutral hydrogen mass fraction
